# 🎵 GestureSynth A-Vision-Based-Hand-Gesture-System-for-Expressive-Musical-Performance
Course Project For Foundations of Human Computer Interaction



**Turn your hand gestures into real-time MIDI music** using just a webcam. No keyboard, no MIDI controller — just your hands and a computer.

GestureSynth uses **MediaPipe** for hand tracking and **MIDI** for musical output, with optional **LLM-powered musical feedback** to help you improve your expressive performance.
