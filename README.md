# GestureSynth – Hand-Gesture MIDI Controller


GestureSynth is a real-time, vision-based MIDI controller that translates hand movement into musical notes. Using MediaPipe for hand tracking and PyQt5 for the interface, it maps hand position to pitch, velocity, and even chords—routing output to any DAW or virtual instrument.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time gesture-to-MIDI conversion** at 30 FPS
- **Multiple velocity modes**: vertical, horizontal, or fixed
- **Chord mode**: play major, minor, or 7th chords with one hand
- **Automatic parameter tuning** via LLM analysis of your playing style
- **MIDI recording & export** as standard `.mid` files
- **Fully offline processing** – your webcam data never leaves your machine
- **Responsive, HCI-optimized UI** following Fitts’s Law, Hick’s Law, and Gestalt principles

## 🖥️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- A standard webcam
- MIDI-compatible software or hardware (e.g., Ableton Live, FL Studio, GarageBand, Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth)
